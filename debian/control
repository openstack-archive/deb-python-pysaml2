Description: SAML Version 2 to be used in a WSGI environment - Python 2.x
 This package provides a Python implementation of SAML Version 2 to be used in
 a WSGI environment.
 .
 From wikipedia: Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) is a version
 of the SAML standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data
 between security domains. SAML 2.0 is an XML-based protocol that uses security
 tokens containing assertions to pass information about a principal (usually an
 end user) between a SAML authority, that is, an identity provider, and a SAML
 consumer, that is, a service provider. SAML 2.0 enables web-based
 authentication and authorization scenarios including cross-domain single
 sign-on (SSO), which helps reduce the administrative overhead of distributing
 multiple authentication tokens to the user.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
